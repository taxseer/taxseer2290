IRS Form 2290 HVUT Payment Options

The most common questions from the HVUT Form 2290 filers are about paying taxes to IRS through credit card. It is important to know that IRS doesnâ€™t accept credit card payment during e-file. Three different options are available through which the HVUT payments can be securely made to the IRS which includes both electronic and check payments. The other question that the filers have in their mind is whether they will receive the IRS stamped proof of payment (Schedule 1) even if they select the check / money order payment option. Yes, you instantly get the schedule 1 as soon as you submit your form 2290 filing through Taxseer2290.com irrespective of the payment mode selected. However, it is your responsibility to make the check / money order / EFTPS payment immediately to avoid any late payment imposed by the IRS for the delay.
